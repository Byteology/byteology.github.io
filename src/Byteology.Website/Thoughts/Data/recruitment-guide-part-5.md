# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 5: Screening Techniques
Screening is widely considered the most challenging aspect of the entire recruitment process. It is during this phase that the most valuable insights about a candidate are acquired. Typically, screening involves one or multiple interviews, but it is essential to minimize their number for the sake of brevity as discussed in previous chapters.

## Preparation
Before commencing the interview, it is essential to review the skill canvas and the candidate's pre-screening results. Appropriate conversations should be carefully constructed in order to evaluate skills that were not adequately covered in the pre-screening phase.

We used the word *"conversation"* instead of *"questions"* on purpose. Questions can only test knowledge and knowledge is only a part of what makes up a skill. A skill encompasses the ability to apply knowledge effectively, which is the primary focus of this evaluation. 

To gauge a candidate's mastery in a particular field, it is beneficial to explore their opinions and how they handle conflicting ideas. For instance, instead of asking a candidate to recite the SOLID principles, which only tests their familiarity with a Wikipedia article, we could inquire about their viewpoint on the controversy surrounding the dependency inversion principle. By analyzing their response and engaging in further discussion, we can assess their ability to examine the topic from various perspectives. This approach enables us to determine their proficiency in the field more reliably.

Once we have prepared multiple conversations for each skill in the canvas, we will be equipped to conduct the interview efficiently, gathering the most valuable information within the allotted time.

## The Interview
An integral objective of the interview is to engage the candidate in their natural mindset, rather than a state of trying to recall information. We can regard these mindsets as different personas, aiming to extract information solely from the persona they will assume while working.

Conducting the interview as a conversation greatly aids in achieving this goal. With sufficient experience, we can seamlessly integrate the prepared topics into a comprehensive dialogue.

Moreover, it is not necessary to delve deeply into every topic. Once we have evaluated a skill with a satisfactory level of confidence, we can smoothly transition to the next area of assessment. The aim is to ensure a seamless flow throughout the interview.

Having prepared multiple conversations per skill allows us to enter a discussion at different points, depending on the current flow of the conversation.

### Addressing Stress
This conversational approach also helps alleviate candidate stress by avoiding an exam-like atmosphere. It is important to acknowledge that interviewees may feel nervous, worried, or even outright scared.

There are several ways to help candidates relax, depending on the situation:

- One approach is to not explicitly acknowledge their nervousness and instead ask a few questions related to the current topic, which you know they will have strong opinions on. This provides them with a moment to gather themselves and regain their composure.
- Another strategy is to offer additional information on a topic the candidate may have omitted. This ensures the conversation flows smoothly, without awkward pauses or abrupt transitions due to their lack of specific knowledge. Furthermore, it allows candidates to learn new things and reduces the time spent on providing feedback later.

If we fail to calm a nervous candidate, continuing the interview may not provide accurate insights into their skills. Instead, it will primarily evaluate their ability to perform under pressure, which is typically not a requirement for their role.

### Allowing Candidates to Choose Topics
It is crucial to remember that interviews are a two-way street (hence the word). Sufficient time should be allocated for candidates to ask questions and stray away from the predefined topics.

This approach offers additional insights into their motivations and areas of expertise, even if these aspects were not thoroughly explored during the rest of the conversation.

### Providing Feedback
After each interview, candidates may request feedback on their performance. Regardless of whether they explicitly ask, it should be provided. This serves several significant purposes:

- Articulating feedback enhances our understanding of what we are seeking in candidates, aiding in the creation of improved skill canvases in the future.
- It fosters trust and transparency between us and the candidate, which is beneficial even if we do not intend to hire them. Many successful candidates have been referred to us by individuals we did not hire.
- It promotes candidates' personal and professional growth, assisting them in becoming better experts in the future. As interviewers, we have a responsibility to support individuals, even if they may not currently fit our organization's requirements.
- Within 30 minutes of the interview, we tend to forget approximately 80% of the feedback we need to provide. Thus, there is no need to delay feedback until a hiring decision is made.

Additionally, regardless of the hiring decision, it is important to take a moment to inform the candidate about the outcome. This gesture demonstrates respect and is likely to leave a positive impression.

## Next Steps
The recruitment process does not conclude with a hire; it continues until the new employee is fully integrated into the team. The subsequent steps involve onboarding and training, which we will discuss in the next part of this guide.
