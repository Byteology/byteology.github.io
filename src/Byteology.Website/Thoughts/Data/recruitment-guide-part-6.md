# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 6: Onboarding and Training
The recruitment process extends beyond the act of hiring and concludes when a new employee becomes fully integrated into the team. This crucial phase is achieved through effective onboarding and training methods.

## Onboarding: A Smooth Integration Process
Each project possesses its own unique set of procedures, technologies, practices, architectural nuances, and domain-specific language. While a proficient specialist may acquire these independently, it can impede their integration timeline. Moreover, inconsistent understanding among team members regarding these project aspects may lead to significant issues down the road.

Although there is no universally applicable onboarding approach due to project variations, it is essential to establish a systematic process. It does not need to be flawless initially but must remain dynamic as outdated onboarding procedures can be counterproductive and detrimental rather than beneficial.

The objective is to encourage every individual who undergoes the onboarding process to enhance it. By doing so, they can address any areas that require improvement or further clarification - a task that can be challenging for seasoned project veterans. 

Over time, as this process is repeated, the onboarding system will evolve to a point where integration becomes nearly instantaneous.

## Training: Filling Skill Gaps
It is important to acknowledge that the likelihood of a new employee perfectly aligning with every skill outlined in the skill canvas is extremely low. This is why various training methods for each skill were incorporated into the canvas.

At times, it is acceptable to hire individuals with identified skill gaps, provided there is a plan in place to bridge those effectively.

Additionally, throughout the project's lifespan, additional areas that require improvement will be inevitably identified. These areas are likely to be shared among multiple team members, making it crucial to proactively address them.

## Final Thoughts
Through our collaborative work, we will gain valuable insights into the individuals we have hired. It is vital to remain vigilant for important skills or characteristics that were not initially identified during the recruitment process and to question why this occurred.

The process itself should be a living and breathing entity that reflects our organization's strengths and values. The moment it becomes rigid or stale so does our organization. Therefore, it is paramount to nurture and continuously enhance the process with meticulous care.
