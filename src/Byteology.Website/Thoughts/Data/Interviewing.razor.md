# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 1: Creating a Skill Canvas

Employees are the lifeblood of every company. They are the ones creating our products, providing our services and driving our growth and innovation. Because of this, it is of utmost importance to choose them with meticulous care.

Unfortunately, this is a difficult process full of pitfalls.  How do you identify a great candidate? How do you even know what *"a great candidate"* is?

We have spent over a decade thinking about these problems and are ready to share some of our insights in this guide. It is written with technical positions in mind but most of it applies to any job opening.

## What is a Skill Canvas

The recruitment process consists of a lot of parts such as crafting job descriptions, pre-screening candidates, preparing interview scenarios, building proper training and onboarding procedures, etc. 

In a successful process all of these work together towards a singular well-defined goal. The skill canvas is a tool that help us define it thus allowing everyone involved in the recruitment process to share the same vision.

The canvas mainly consists of a list of unambiguously described and quantified skills of what we are looking for in a candidate as well as the reasoning behind it.

Creating it is arguably the most important step in the whole process yet it is oftentimes either completely ignored or it's being done idly by a single person for less than an hour.

## The Skill List

The first step of creating a skill canvas is to list all skills related to the particular position. 

Though remember, we are not looking for the perfect human being. We probably don't need a team full of team leaders or people thinking outside of the box.

It helps tremendously to write down a once-sentence reasoning of why we chose each of the skills listed. It keeps everyone on board and it makes future analysis easier.

Although, not necessary, we can group the skills in two categories:

### Technical Skills

Technical skills are the ones that are related to some kind of expertise regarding a certain piece of technology, software or specialized knowledge and are deeply rooted in a particular field of study. Usually they will be listed by the engineering team.

### Personal Skills

Personal skills or soft skills are the ones that do not relate to a particular field of study. They might be willingness to teach or mentor others, the ability to organize a group of people, a certain way of tackling problems, dealing with interpersonal issues, working under pressure, etc.

## Skill Definitions and Expertise Levels

At this point we might have written something along the lines of <q>The candidate must have at least 5 years of experience working in microservices architectures</q>. Bear in mind that experience is only a small part of what builds up mastery and is not really a skill.

Let's try to be a little bit more specific about what this kind experience means to us. For example, we might be looking for a particular level of autonomy when solving problems that our new employee will encounter: <q>The candidate should be able to investigate and identify race conditions within a complex microservice architecture on their own</q>.

Phrasing it like that will help us immensely in crafting both our job description and interview scenarios and allows everyone involved in the recruitment process to share the same vision.

## Quantifying the Skills

It is highly unlikely that during the recruitment process we'll be able to test all candidates on every single skill on the canvas with as much depth as we would like. Because of this we need some kind of system to help us define our strategy.

To do this, we should evaluate all skills on the canvas on two additional characteristics.

### Importance

This will help us at the later stages of the process by allowing us to focus our efforts on the things that matter most. Generally, there are 3 types of skills:

- **Core** - a skill that is essential for the job and is strictly necessary for even attempting it.
- **Auxiliary** - a skill that is not necessarily required for the job but has a substantial impact on it.
- **Tangent** - a skill that is somehow related to the job but it is possible for a skilled professional to lack it.

### Teachability

Next, it is time to determine what is the approximate cost for teaching each of the skills. Every skill generally falls in one of these 3 categories.

- **Internally teachable** - a skill that our organization has the ability and resources to teach. The resources usually are the time of the trainee and the availability of willing and able personnel that will conduct some kind of a training program.
- **Externally teachable** - a skill that our organization doesn't have the ability or resources to teach internally but can afford to outsource it. The resources that are usually associated with that are the time of the trainee, and the financial cost of the third-party that will conduct the training.
- **Unteachable** - a skill that is not teachable given a reasonable amount of time or other resources. 

## Next Steps

Having completed the skill canvas, we can now be sure that every single step of the recruitment process will work in unison towards the same goal. 

Next, we are ready to start defining our recruitment strategy.






















# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 2: Defining a Strategy

Now that we have our skill canvas completed, we are ready to continue with the next step of the process and we'll begin by evaluating the constraints within which we'll be operating.

## Constraints Evaluation

When recruiting we are always constrained by some kind of resources. Some of the most common are deadlines, the availability of key people involved in the process and finances.

Being aware of these constraints allows us to create a skill-testing strategy that will increase our chances of successful recruitment tremendously. Let's examine some of them:

### Deadlines

A deadline refers to the time available before a new employee has to be integrated as a part of the team and work (semi-)independently. Having a short deadline reduces the time we have for both the recruitment process itself and any potential trainings. 

When faced with a strict deadline we must take into consideration the amount of time it would require for a candidate to learn each of the teachable core skills they might be missing and add it to their potential start date. If this extends past the deadline it means that we have to test teachable core skills with way higher confidence than usual as we can't afford to teach them later. 

Another problem with strict deadlines is that they introduce a time limit for the recruitment process as a whole. If this limit is too short we might not be able to interview enough people and might have to choose from a suboptimal pool of talents. This can be somehow mitigated in two ways:

 The first is by having multiple teams working on the recruitment process asynchronously but this comes with the price of reduced consistency between interviews. 
 
 The second way is to reduce the thoroughness of the process which can actually be a good thing but we'll talk about that a little bit later. 

### Team Availability

Another common constraint we face is team availability. This occurs most noticeably in the team members responsible for performing interviews. These people are usually heavily involved in the core operations of the business and might not have enough time for recruitment work.

Additionally they might not have the optimal interviewing skillset as it is usually different then the one required for their actual jobs.

There are a few ways to tackle this. The easiest one is to outsource some of the work as this will let our existing team members to focus on the core business of our organization.

Another way to deal with this is to teach and enable more people to perform interviews. Bear in mind that it certainly helps but it is not a necessity to have the most experienced and valuable team members (in term of the core business) to participate heavily in the recruitment process.

### Finances

Having a tight constraint on the finances for the recruitment process can limit our options but there is no real way around that. We might like to reduce the outsourced part of the recruitment process as much as possible at the cost of team availability and we'll have to achieve greater confidence when testing skills that are otherwise externally teachable.

## Thoroughness vs Brevity

The longer our interview process is - the higher chances we have to correctly determine if a potential applicant is a good fit. The problem is that we have limited time and resources.

In other words - the longer we spend on a single application - the less applicants we'll be able to interview, thus reducing our chances to find a good fit. On the other hand, if we don't spend enough time - we won't be able to identify potentially great candidates.

Additionally, candidates usually don't stop applying for other positions in different companies until they get a satisfactory job offer and if they receive one in the middle of our interview process, it is very unlikely they'll finish it.

Fortunately, the benefits of increasing the thoroughness of our process quickly hits diminishing returns and with careful planning and consideration you might be able to get to this point while simultaneously keeping the process quite brief.

## The Game Plan

Now that we are aware of our requirements and constrains it is time to write down our strategy. It usually consists of a few things:

- The number of people we would like to interview and the time we will spend on each one
- The confidence with which we would like to test each skill on the canvas
- The means of testing each skill in terms of which part(s) of the process is able to do it with the required confidence
- Which people or teams will be responsible for each subsequent part of the process
- A plan for training and onboarding the new hirees

## Next Steps

At this point we can treat the process as any other project and apply similar project management techniques.

Next we'll take a look at some of the important steps of the recruitment process and how we can use them to execute our strategy.

























# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 3: Job Description

Now that we have a skill canvas and a defined strategy it is time to prepare the job description. 

A carefully crafted job description can improve the odds of finding the right candidate tremendously but to do that we first need to understand a few things.

## How Potential Candidates Interact With Job Descriptions

***Note:*** *Everything in this section has a big "in general" asterisk attached to it. Additionally, this is the most opinionated part of this guide so take it with a grain of salt.*

Potential candidates will rarely stumble upon our job advert by accident. Most of the time they are actively looking for their next job and are either being targeted by sourcers or are browsing through some kind of job adverts portal.

In both cases they have to deal with a tremendous amount of barely filtered job descriptions and decide for which ones to apply.

Unfortunately, potential candidates have limited time as well, so they are not going to go through the details of every single one in order to figure out if they are a good match before applying. Because of that they are playing a numbers game.

First, by just by glancing at the title of the job description they are trying to determine if the chances they are a good fit are above median.

The titles of job adverts are usually some kind of skill requirement and the potential candidates will answer their question by figuring out if they have this particular skill.

The problem is that the more vague the skill is - the less an affirmative answer raises the odds of being a good fit. For example, falling into the category of *"Senior Software Engineer"* means a lot less than *"C#.NET Developer with SAP B1 experience for a marketplace"*.

Once a potential candidate has clicked on a job advert, comes their second problem: how to determine if the time they will spend applying for this position will be worth the chance they'll be be a good fit.

This usually happens by checking the listed requirements. If they consider themselves to possess around 70% (sometimes even lower) of the listed skills - they will consider applying for the position. Take a note of that. It will help us a little bit later in a non-intuitive way. 

If the candidate is not able to answer that question fast, they will most likely resort to going back to browsing adverts.

Only after the potential candidate has decided that it might be worth their while to apply for this position, they may try to figure out if they'll actually like working at it. They'll scan the job description for any clues about that and this will be their last deciding factor before they take action.

## The Goals of a Job Description
	
Before starting to craft our job description, we need to know one more thing: what makes a successful job description.

After publishing the job advert only a certain number of people will actually see or be interested in it and the higher this number is - the higher the chances that a great candidate will be among them. So the first goal of a successful job advert is to increase the number of people that will interact with it.

At some point candidates will start sending applications. In most cases they will be way more than we have resources to interview people and we'll have to resort to screening them by their application alone, which is not really effective for reasons we will describe later.

Fortunately, a great tool for screening candidates is the job description itself. If we craft it correctly it will automatically filter a lot of the people that are not a good fit but we have to be careful not to filter great candidates as well. So how do we do that?

## Crafting The Job Description

Armed with this knowledge and the skill canvas we created earlier, we are now ready to craft the perfect job description.

### The Title

Let's begin with the title. As we said earlier in order to attract the highest number of relevant candidates we must set the title to be the core requirement of the position written in the most specific way possible.

We can also safely remove expertise levels like *"Junior/Regular/Senior"* because they are way too subjective and this makes them vague. A potential candidate's idea of these levels may and will wildly differ from yours.

The only exception being intern positions as pretty much everyone has the same understanding of the word *"intern"*.

### Technical Skill Requirements

Now let's continue with the list of skill requirements. Remember when we said that people will apply if they think they possess 70% of the required skills? This means that the bigger the list - the higher the chance candidates will apply while missing some of the core skills for the position and this might be a hard thing to catch on the application level.

So our best option is to include only the core skills from the skill canvas but don't worry, we'll test for the auxiliary skills in other parts of the process.

We will want to write these skill requirements as specific as possible for the same reason we wrote the title that way. People are objectively bad at evaluating themselves and the more vague a skill is described - the more likely it is for them to think they possess it.

We will also ditch the *"required years of experience"* for a certain technology. Experience is only a small part of what builds up expertise and people know or at least feel it so they are inclined to ignore it. Also there are so many job adverts out there that require an unreasonable amount of years of experience that there are running jokes about it and at some point people stopped paying attention.

Instead we might just explain what those years of experience mean to us. E.g. <q>You should be able to understand and optimize SQL Server execution plans</q>. Fortunately, we already did that when creating the skill canvas.

### Personal Skill Requirements
		
We don’t want to list any of the personal skills we are looking for in the job description. People are even more terrible at self-evaluating their personal skills than their technical ones. We have never met a single person that said they are not a great problem solver or fast learner.

If we include the personal skills, potential candidates will mentally check them off when skimming through the list of requirements and this will make them more likely to apply even if they miss some of the core technical skills.

We might want to include the required personal skills in the job advert though. We will do that but we'll cast it in another light. Instead of making potential candidates decide if they have a list of personal skills we would want them to dislike the position if they lack them.

One way to do that is by describing how an example workday at that position might look like with a heavy emphasis on the personal skills required.

For example, instead of saying <q>The perfect candidate must have excellent time management skills</q>, let's take a moment and think about why we would want this skill from a candidate. Then we might explain how it will be connected to their work: <q>You'll have to assess priorities in a tight deadline environment and act upon them</q>.

This will discourage people lacking this particular skill from applying without them even knowing they have just self-evaluated it.

## Stating the Budget

Should we state the budget for the position in the job description? There is no one right answer to this question so let's think a little bit about the pros and cons of stating the budget upfront.

### Pros

- It statistically increases the number of people that apply for the position (which might or might not be a good thing depending on how many candidates we are expecting).

- It will also automatically filter candidates that are out of our price range. The budget talks usually happen after the interview rounds which means that we might have wasted precious resources interviewing a candidate that we can't hire for budget reasons instead of interviewing another one.

- Discussing the expected salary with a candidate is more or less a kind of bargaining which might make them feel like their new employer does not share their best interest which is not a great way to start a relationship.

### Cons

- If the job offer is in the lower half of the listed budget, the candidate might feel cheated. We are inevitably going to pay more than we would have otherwise but to be fair we can think of this money as being spent for the better well-being of our new employee.

- We are giving insights of our budget to our direct competitors which might not be a good idea if we think there is somebody who is actively looking to outbid us.

### Everything Else

At this point we should be done crafting our job description. Everything else can be safely removed in order to keep it short. 

If someone is really interested in our company they will probably go to our website to check for more information. Making the advert unnecessarily large will only reduce the number of people who will actually read it.

## Next Steps

This way of crafting job descriptions maximizes the chance of the right candidate applying for the job. At the same time it minimizes the number of non-suitable applications thus allowing us to easily identify the right one.

At this point we should have received a bit more applications than people we can interview so our next step is to pre-screen the applicants and get a shortlist.


















# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 4: Pre-screening

When doing talent sourcing one of our goals is to attract as many candidates as possible. Of course we won't have the resources to interview all of them so we need some kind of tools that can do a rough estimation of an applicant's skills with as much effort as possible. This allows us to create a shortlist of people that we'll interview.

Let's take a look at some of the tools at our disposal:

## Resumes

It might be tempting to pick the best-looking and the most refined resumes and it is definitely a tell about certain personal skills but bear in mind that you are not looking for the person who is able to craft the best CV.

Instead we should be looking for signs about the presence of skills from the skill canvas. This is a tricky thing to do but if we are able to give a one-sentence reasoning on why we believe a certain detail in the resume corresponds to a certain skill - it will increase our chances of shortlisting the appropriate candidates. 

The only other thing we can do is keep statistics. We should keep track which universities and previous employers yielded successful interviews in the past. Maybe a certain style of writing, certain kind of certifications or something entirely different.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't give a chance to anyone that doesn't fit our statistics but it might help us when we are hard-pressed to choose which applicants to interview.

Basically we should create some kind of system to help us order applications but this is the part of the process in which we are trying to make a decision having only minimal information. This is why keeping statistics is our best bet in the long term.

## Motivation Letters

Motivation letters are a very specific tool at our disposal. They increase the thoroughness of our interview process but in return they pre-screen a lot of candidates. This can be of great help if we are receiving way too many applications than we can handle but unfortunately, it might not be an accurate screening.

They make the process of applying harder which filters candidates based on motivation (hence the name) to apply for this exact job or sometimes by desperation to get any job at all.

Additionally, we will want to actually read and evaluate these letters and this costs additional resources while filtering candidates on what is basically an essay for a job that probably has nothing to do with writing.

One great use for motivation letters though, is for intern positions or positions for which candidates are not required to have any previous experience. In these situations it might be really difficult to distinguish between candidates and their motivation letters might be the only tool we have available.

## Homework Assignments

Homework assignments are a great way to increase the thoroughness of the interview process while keeping it brief (for us at least) although they come with a different load of problems.

- It is hard to craft a homework assignment that will properly reflect the skills we are looking for.

- We'll have to do it over and over again. It is surprising how fast the assignments and their proper solutions leak to the public. Additionally, different positions require different assignments.

- We can't be sure that the solution comes from the assignee. Because of that we should at least schedule a call to talk with them about the solution. This combined with the actual grading of the solution will take time that we might want to spend somewhere else in the process.

- The whole homework assignment, grading and the follow-up interview may take weeks and during this time the candidate might receive a job offer from another company which may cause them to drop out of our interview process.

## Others

There are a plethora of other tools to do pre-screening such as HR interviews, logic tests, quick coding problems, etc. When deciding which ones to use, though, we need to make sure they align with the skill canvas. Additionally, we should be aware of the resources they consume and the confidence of their skill estimations.

## Next Steps

At this point we should have a shortlist of people we would like to call in for an interview.

We probably have some limited information about each of them so we should start preparing and choosing interview scenarios based on that.

As for the applicants that didn't make it, we should inform them via some kind of an automated channel.















# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 5: The Interview

The actual interview is arguably the hardest part of the whole process. During it we'll be gathering the majority of information about the candidates thus helping us make an informed decision. However, we have only so much time to gather that information so we need to carefully prepare beforehand.

## Preparation

Let's take a look at the skill canvas and focus our efforts on them. We should carefully craft appropriate conversations beforehand. We used the word *"conversation"* instead of *"questions"* on purpose.

The interview is not a trivia exam. We might ask a candidate something along the lines of <q>Can you tell me about the SOLID principles</q> but that usually doesn't help us understand if the candidate has the required skills to apply them in practice.

Instead we might want to ask them for their opinion on the controversy around the dependency inversion principle. Maybe they will try to defend it, maybe they will try to prove that it is too extreme, maybe they will hold an opinion that it is more of a guideline than an actual rule. Either way we'll understand a lot more about the interviewee than checking if they have read the Wikipedia article or have been asked the same question at another interview.

The goal is to keep a conversation going so the candidate is in their usual mindset instead of their *"trying to remember something"* one.

## About Stress

This way of conducting the interview also helps the candidate feel more comfortable because they don't follow the exam scenario. We should understand that the interviewee is in a bad spot. They might be nervous, worried or outright scared.

This might happen because getting this job is really important to them, because there are five people who are conducting this interview (please keep this number to a minimum) or they just might have trouble keeping calm when they are asked about a topic they are not confident in.

On that note, we should always be aware of how nervous the interviewee is at any moment and try to calm them down. There are many ways to do so and they vary depending on the situation but we'll list a couple of the most common and successful ones.

- The first one is to not acknowledge that they are nervous and just ask them a couple of related to the current topic questions you know they will answer correctly. This gives them a moment to catch their breath and get back into *"the zone"*.

- Another one is to actually take time and provide some additional information on the topic that the candidate omitted. This makes them feel better because the conversation is going on without having weird pauses or jumps due to their lack of certain knowledge. It also helps them learn new things and it reduces the time you'll spend on providing feedback later.

If we fail to calm down a nervous candidate, continuing the interview will not tell us anything about their skills. Instead it will tell us how well they can work under pressure which is usually not a requirement for their job.

 ## Let Candidates Choose Topics

- We must remember that the interview is a two-way street. This is what *"inter"* means. There should be enough time to let the person ask you questions and to pick their own topics. This way we may also understand a little bit more about them, about what drives them and what they find interesting.

## Feedback

After every interview candidates may ask for feedback on how they have done. But regardless of whether they did it or not, we should provide it. This serves a few really important purposes.

- Verbalizing the feedback helps us better understand what we are looking for and helps us craft better interviews in the future.

- It builds trust and transparency between us and the candidate. That's a great thing to do even if we don't plan to hire them. We have had many successful candidates referred to us by people we haven't hired.

- It helps the candidates grow and become better experts in the future and as interviewers we have a responsibility to try and help people even if they are not the right fit for our company right now.

- 30 minutes after the interview, we forget about 70% of the feedback that we have to give. We don't need to wait for a hiring decision before giving our feedback.

- And on that note when a hiring decision is made, we should take a minute and inform the candidate regardless of the decision itself. They will appreciate it tremendously and will probably spread a good word.














# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 6: Training and Onboarding
