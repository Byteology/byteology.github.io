# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 6: Onboarding and Trainings

The recruitment process doesn't end with a hiring. It ends when we have a new employee that is fully integrated within the team. This usually happens through onboarding and trainings. 

## Onboarding 

Every project has its own specifics in terms of procedures, technologies, practices, architecture or even domain language. While a skilled specialist may be able to learn all of these on their own it would negatively impact their time to integration. Additionally, this will make it possible for different team members to have different understanding on the aforementioned aspects of the project which might lead to severe issues down the road.

And while there is no single way to do great onboarding as it differs from project to project, it is important to have a system in place. It doesn't need to be perfect at first but it needs to be alive. There is nothing worse than an outdated onboarding procedure that can sometimes do more harm than help.

The goal is to have every person that goes through it to upgrade it. This way they can improve it on areas it was missing or it wasn't clear enough - a task that is really hard to do for a veteran in the project.

In time our onboarding system will become good enough that the integration time will become almost instantaneous.

## Trainings

Another thing to keep in mind is that the chances that our new employee scored perfectly on every skill in the skill canvas is close to zero. This is one of the reasons why we included possible training methods for each skill.

Sometimes it is perfectly acceptable to hire someone with already identified gaps in the skill canvas but only if we have a plan on how to close them. 

Additionally, during the lifetime of the project we'll inevitably identify additional areas for improvement that are most likely to be shared between multiple team members and it is always a good idea to act on them.

## Last Words

In the process of working together we'll learn a lot about the people we hired. It is important to be on the lookout for important skills or characteristics that we didn't manage to identify during the recruitment process and ask ourselves *"why"*.

The process itself should be a living and breathing being that reflects our organization's strengths and values. The moment it becomes rigid or stale so does our organization and because of that we should always take meticulous care of it and continuously strive to improve it
