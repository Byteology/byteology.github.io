# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 1: Creating a Skill Canvas

Employees are the lifeblood of every company. They are the ones creating our products, providing our services and driving our growth and innovation. Because of this, it is of utmost importance to choose them with meticulous care.

Unfortunately, this is a difficult process full of pitfalls.  How do you identify a great candidate? How do you even know what *"a great candidate"* is?

We have spent over a decade thinking about these problems and are ready to share some of our insights in this guide. It is written with technical positions in mind but most of it applies to any job opening.

## What is a Skill Canvas

The recruitment process consists of a lot of parts such as crafting job descriptions, pre-screening candidates, preparing interview scenarios, building proper training and onboarding procedures, etc. 

In a successful process all of these work together towards a singular well-defined goal. The skill canvas is a tool that help us define it thus allowing everyone involved in the recruitment process to share the same vision.

The canvas mainly consists of a list of unambiguously described and quantified skills of what we are looking for in a candidate as well as the reasoning behind it.

Creating it is arguably the most important step in the whole process yet it is oftentimes either completely ignored or it's being done idly by a single person for less than an hour.

## The Skill List

The first step of creating a skill canvas is to list all skills related to the particular position. 

Though remember, we are not looking for the perfect human being. We probably don't need a team full of team leaders or people thinking outside of the box.

It helps tremendously to write down a once-sentence reasoning of why we chose each of the skills listed. It keeps everyone on board and it makes future analysis easier.

Although, not necessary, we can group the skills in two categories:

### Technical Skills

Technical skills are the ones that are related to some kind of expertise regarding a certain piece of technology, software or specialized knowledge and are deeply rooted in a particular field of study. Usually they will be listed by the engineering team.

### Personal Skills

Personal skills or soft skills are the ones that do not relate to a particular field of study. They might be willingness to teach or mentor others, the ability to organize a group of people, a certain way of tackling problems, dealing with interpersonal issues, working under pressure, etc.

## Skill Definitions and Expertise Levels

At this point we might have written something along the lines of <q>The candidate must have at least 5 years of experience working in microservices architectures</q>. Bear in mind that experience is only a small part of what builds up mastery and is not really a skill.

Let's try to be a little bit more specific about what this kind experience means to us. For example, we might be looking for a particular level of autonomy when solving problems that our new employee will encounter: <q>The candidate should be able to investigate and identify race conditions within a complex microservice architecture on their own</q>.

Phrasing it like that will help us immensely in crafting both our job description and interview scenarios and allows everyone involved in the recruitment process to share the same vision.

## Quantifying the Skills

It is highly unlikely that during the recruitment process we'll be able to test all candidates on every single skill on the canvas with as much depth as we would like. Because of this we need some kind of system to help us define our strategy.

To do this, we should evaluate all skills on the canvas on two additional characteristics.

### Importance

This will help us at the later stages of the process by allowing us to focus our efforts on the things that matter most. Generally, there are 3 types of skills:

- **Core** - a skill that is essential for the job and is strictly necessary for even attempting it.
- **Auxiliary** - a skill that is not necessarily required for the job but has a substantial impact on it.
- **Tangent** - a skill that is somehow related to the job but it is possible for a skilled professional to lack it.

### Teachability

Next, it is time to determine what is the approximate cost for teaching each of the skills. Every skill generally falls in one of these 3 categories.

- **Internally teachable** - a skill that our organization has the ability and resources to teach. The resources usually are the time of the trainee and the availability of willing and able personnel that will conduct some kind of a training program.
- **Externally teachable** - a skill that our organization doesn't have the ability or resources to teach internally but can afford to outsource it. The resources that are usually associated with that are the time of the trainee, and the financial cost of the third-party that will conduct the training.
- **Unteachable** - a skill that is not teachable given a reasonable amount of time or other resources. 

## Next Steps

Having completed the skill canvas, we can now be sure that every single step of the recruitment process will work in unison towards the same goal. 

Next, we are ready to start defining our recruitment strategy.






















# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 2: Defining a Strategy

Now that we have our skill canvas completed, we are ready to continue with the next step of the process and we'll begin by evaluating the constraints within which we'll be operating.

## Constraints Evaluation

When recruiting we are always constrained by some kind of resources. Some of the most common are deadlines, the availability of key people involved in the process and finances.

Being aware of these constraints allows us to create a skill-testing strategy that will increase our chances of successful recruitment tremendously. Let's examine some of them:

### Deadlines

A deadline refers to the time available before a new employee has to be integrated as a part of the team and work (semi-)independently. Having a short deadline reduces the time we have for both the recruitment process itself and any potential trainings. 

When faced with a strict deadline we must take into consideration the amount of time it would require for a candidate to learn each of the teachable core skills they might be missing and add it to their potential start date. If this extends past the deadline it means that we have to test teachable core skills with way higher confidence than usual as we can't afford to teach them later. 

Another problem with strict deadlines is that they introduce a time limit for the recruitment process as a whole. If this limit is too short we might not be able to interview enough people and might have to choose from a suboptimal pool of talents. This can be somehow mitigated in two ways:

 The first is by having multiple teams working on the recruitment process asynchronously but this comes with the price of reduced consistency between interviews. 
 
 The second way is to reduce the thoroughness of the process which can actually be a good thing but we'll talk about that a little bit later. 

### Team Availability

Another common constraint we face is team availability. This occurs most noticeably in the team members responsible for performing interviews. These people are usually heavily involved in the core operations of the business and might not have enough time for recruitment work.

Additionally they might not have the optimal interviewing skillset as it is usually different then the one required for their actual jobs.

There are a few ways to tackle this. The easiest one is to outsource some of the work as this will let our existing team members to focus on the core business of our organization.

Another way to deal with this is to teach and enable more people to perform interviews. Bear in mind that it certainly helps but it is not a necessity to have the most experienced and valuable team members (in term of the core business) to participate heavily in the recruitment process.

### Finances

Having a tight constraint on the finances for the recruitment process can limit our options but there is no real way around that. We might like to reduce the outsourced part of the recruitment process as much as possible at the cost of team availability and we'll have to achieve greater confidence when testing skills that are otherwise externally teachable.

## Thoroughness vs Brevity

The longer our interview process is - the higher chances we have to correctly determine if a potential applicant is a good fit. The problem is that we have limited time and resources.

In other words - the longer we spend on a single application - the less applicants we'll be able to interview, thus reducing our chances to find a good fit. On the other hand, if we don't spend enough time - we won't be able to identify potentially great candidates.

Additionally, candidates usually don't stop applying for other positions in different companies until they get a satisfactory job offer and if they receive one in the middle of our interview process, it is very unlikely they'll finish it.

Fortunately, the benefits of increasing the thoroughness of our process quickly hits diminishing returns and with careful planning and consideration you might be able to get to this point while simultaneously keeping the process quite brief.

## The Game Plan

Now that we are aware of our requirements and constrains it is time to write down our strategy. It usually consists of a few things:

- The number of people we would like to interview and the time we will spend on each one
- The confidence with which we would like to test each skill on the canvas
- The means of testing each skill in terms of which part(s) of the process is able to do it with the required confidence
- Which people or teams will be responsible for each subsequent part of the process
- A plan for training and onboarding the new hirees

## Next Steps

At this point we can treat the process as any other project and apply similar project management techniques.

Next we'll take a look at some of the important steps of the recruitment process and how we can use them to execute our strategy.

























# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 3: Job Description

Now that we have a skill canvas and a defined strategy it is time to prepare the job description. 

A carefully crafted job description can improve the odds of finding the right candidate tremendously but to do that we first need to understand a few things.

## How Potential Candidates Interact With Job Descriptions

***Note:*** *Everything in this section has a big "in general" asterisk attached to it. Additionally, this is the most opinionated part of this guide so take it with a grain of salt.*

Potential candidates will rarely stumble upon our job advert by accident. Most of the time they are actively looking for their next job and are either being targeted by sourcers or are browsing through some kind of job adverts portal.

In both cases they have to deal with a tremendous amount of barely filtered job descriptions and decide for which ones to apply.

Unfortunately, potential candidates have limited time as well, so they are not going to go through the details of every single one in order to figure out if they are a good match before applying. Because of that they are playing a numbers game.

First, by just by glancing at the title of the job description they are trying to determine if the chances they are a good fit are above median.

The titles of job adverts are usually some kind of skill requirement and the potential candidates will answer their question by figuring out if they have this particular skill.

The problem is that the more vague the skill is - the less an affirmative answer raises the odds of being a good fit. For example, falling into the category of *"Senior Software Engineer"* means a lot less than *"C#.NET Developer with SAP B1 experience for a marketplace"*.

Once a potential candidate has clicked on a job advert, comes their second problem: how to determine if the time they will spend applying for this position will be worth the chance they'll be be a good fit.

This usually happens by checking the listed requirements. If they consider themselves to possess around 70% (sometimes even lower) of the listed skills - they will consider applying for the position. Take a note of that. It will help us a little bit later in a non-intuitive way. 

If the candidate is not able to answer that question fast, they will most likely resort to going back to browsing adverts.

Only after the potential candidate has decided that it might be worth their while to apply for this position, they may try to figure out if they'll actually like working at it. They'll scan the job description for any clues about that and this will be their last deciding factor before they take action.

## The Goals of a Job Description
	
Before starting to craft our job description, we need to know one more thing: what makes a successful job description.

After publishing the job advert only a certain number of people will actually see or be interested in it and the higher this number is - the higher the chances that a great candidate will be among them. So the first goal of a successful job advert is to increase the number of people that will interact with it.

At some point candidates will start sending applications. In most cases they will be way more than we have resources to interview people and we'll have to resort to screening them by their application alone, which is not really effective for reasons we will describe later.

Fortunately, a great tool for screening candidates is the job description itself. If we craft it correctly it will automatically filter a lot of the people that are not a good fit but we have to be careful not to filter great candidates as well. So how do we do that?

## Crafting The Job Description

Armed with this knowledge and the skill canvas we created earlier, we are now ready to craft the perfect job description.

### The Title

Let's begin with the title. As we said earlier in order to attract the highest number of relevant candidates we must set the title to be the core requirement of the position written in the most specific way possible.

We can also safely remove expertise levels like *"Junior/Regular/Senior"* because they are way too subjective and this makes them vague. A potential candidate's idea of these levels may and will wildly differ from yours.

The only exception being intern positions as pretty much everyone has the same understanding of the word *"intern"*.

### Technical Skill Requirements

Now let's continue with the list of skill requirements. Remember when we said that people will apply if they think they possess 70% of the required skills? This means that the bigger the list - the higher the chance candidates will apply while missing some of the core skills for the position and this might be a hard thing to catch on the application level.

So our best option is to include only the core skills from the skill canvas but don't worry, we'll test for the auxiliary skills in other parts of the process.

We will want to write these skill requirements as specific as possible for the same reason we wrote the title that way. People are objectively bad at evaluating themselves and the more vague a skill is described - the more likely it is for them to think they possess it.

We will also ditch the *"required years of experience"* for a certain technology. Experience is only a small part of what builds up expertise and people know or at least feel it so they are inclined to ignore it. Also there are so many job adverts out there that require an unreasonable amount of years of experience that there are running jokes about it and at some point people stopped paying attention.

Instead we might just explain what those years of experience mean to us. E.g. <q>You should be able to understand and optimize SQL Server execution plans</q>. Fortunately, we already did that when creating the skill canvas.

### Personal Skill Requirements
		
We don’t want to list any of the personal skills we are looking for in the job description. People are even more terrible at self-evaluating their personal skills than their technical ones. We have never met a single person that said they are not a great problem solver or fast learner.

If we include the personal skills, potential candidates will mentally check them off when skimming through the list of requirements and this will make them more likely to apply even if they miss some of the core technical skills.

We might want to include the required personal skills in the job advert though. We will do that but we'll cast it in another light. Instead of making potential candidates decide if they have a list of personal skills we would want them to dislike the position if they lack them.

One way to do that is by describing how an example workday at that position might look like with a heavy emphasis on the personal skills required.

For example, instead of saying <q>The perfect candidate must have excellent time management skills</q>, let's take a moment and think about why we would want this skill from a candidate. Then we might explain how it will be connected to their work: <q>You'll have to assess priorities in a tight deadline environment and act upon them</q>.

This will discourage people lacking this particular skill from applying without them even knowing they have just self-evaluated it.

### Everything Else

At this point we should be done crafting our job description. Everything else can be safely removed in order to keep it short. 

If someone is really interested in our company they will probably go to our website to check for more information. Making the advert unnecessarily large will only reduce the number of people who will actually read it.

## Next Steps

This way of crafting job descriptions maximizes the chance of the right candidate applying for the job. At the same time it minimizes the number of non-suitable applications thus allowing us to easily identify the right one.

At this point we should have received a bit more applications than people we can interview so our next step is to pre-screen the applicants and get a shortlist.
