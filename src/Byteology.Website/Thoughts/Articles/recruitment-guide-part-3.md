# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 3: Crafting a Job Description

Now that we have a skill canvas and a defined strategy for filling our open position it is time to prepare the job description. 

A carefully crafted job description can improve the odds of finding the right candidate tremendously but to do that we first need to understand a few things.

## How Potential Candidates Interact With Job Descriptions

***Note:*** *Everything in this section has a big "in general" asterisk attached to it. Additionally, this is the most opinionated part of this guide so take it with a grain of salt.*

Potential candidates will rarely stumble upon our job advert by accident. Most of the time they are actively looking for their next job and are either being targeted by sourcers or are browsing through some kind of job adverts portal.

In both cases they have to deal with a tremendous amount of barely filtered job descriptions and decide for which ones to apply.

Unfortunately, potential candidates have limited time as well, so they are not going to go through the details of every single one in order to figure out if they are a good match before applying. Because of that they are playing a numbers game.

First, by just by glancing at the title of the job description they are trying to determine if the chances they are a good fit are above median.

The titles of job adverts are usually some kind of skill requirement and the potential candidates will answer their question by figuring out if they have this particular skill.

The problem is that the more vague the skill is - the less an affirmative answer raises the odds of being a good fit. For example, falling into the category of *"Senior Software Engineer"* means a lot less than *"C#.NET Developer with SAP B1 experience for a marketplace"*.

Once a potential candidate has clicked on a job advert, comes their second problem: how to determine if the time they will spend applying for this position will be worth the chance they'll be be a good fit.

This usually happens by checking the listed requirements. If they consider themselves to possess around 70% (sometimes even lower) of the listed skills - they will consider applying for the position. Take a note of that. It will help us a little bit later in a non-intuitive way. 

If the candidate is not able to answer that question fast, they will most likely resort to going back to browsing adverts.

Only after the potential candidate has decided that it might be worth their while to apply for this position, they may try to figure out if they'll actually like working at it. They'll scan the job description for any clues about that and this will be their last deciding factor before they take action.

## The Goals of a Job Description
	
Before starting to craft our job description, we need to know one more thing: what is the purpose of job descriptions.

After publishing the job advert only a certain number of people will actually see or be interested in it and the higher this number is - the higher the chances that a great candidate will be among them. So the first goal of a successful job advert is to increase the number of people that will interact with it.

The problem is that at some point candidates will start sending applications and in most cases they will be way more than we have resources to interview people. At this point we'll have to put a lot of pressure on the pre-screening process, which comes with a lot of drawbacks for reasons we will describe later.

Fortunately, a great tool for avoiding this scenario is the job description itself. If we craft it correctly it will automatically filter a lot of the people that are not a good fit. We have to be careful though, not to filter great candidates as well. So how do we do that?

## Crafting The Job Description

Armed with this knowledge and the skill canvas we created earlier, we are now ready to craft the perfect job description.

### The Title

Let's begin with the title. As we said earlier in order to attract the highest number of relevant candidates we must set the title to be the core requirement of the position written in the most specific way possible. This will also prevent people who are not a good fit to apply thus reducing the load on the pre-screening process.

We can also safely remove expertise levels like *"Junior/Regular/Senior"* because they are way too subjective and this makes them vague. A potential candidate's idea of these levels may and will wildly differ from yours.

The only exception being intern positions as pretty much everyone has the same understanding of the word *"intern"*.

### Technical Skill Requirements

Now let's continue with the list of skill requirements. Remember when we said that people will apply if they think they possess 70% of the required skills? This means that the bigger the list - the higher the chance candidates will apply while missing some of the core skills for the position and this might be a hard thing to catch on the application level.

So our best option is to include only the core skills from the skill canvas but don't worry, we'll test for the auxiliary skills in other parts of the process.

We will want to write these skill requirements as specific as possible for the same reason we wrote the title that way. People are objectively bad at evaluating themselves and the more vague a skill is described - the more likely it is for them to think they possess it.

We will also ditch the *"required years of experience"* for a certain technology. Experience is only a small part of what builds up expertise and people know or at least feel it so they are inclined to ignore it. Also there are so many job adverts out there that require an unreasonable amount of years of experience that there are running jokes about it and at some point people stopped paying attention.

Instead we might just explain what those years of experience mean to us. E.g. <q>You should be able to understand and optimize complex SQL Server execution plans</q>. Fortunately, we already did that when creating the skill canvas.

### Personal Skill Requirements
		
We donâ€™t want to list any of the personal skills we are looking for in the job description. People are even more terrible at self-evaluating their personal skills than their technical ones. We have never met a single person that said they are not a great problem solver or fast learner.

If we include the personal skills, potential candidates will mentally check them off when skimming through the list of requirements and this will make them more likely to apply even if they miss some of the core technical skills.

We might want to include the core personal skills in the job advert though but we will do it by casting it in a different light. Instead of making potential candidates decide if they have a list of personal skills we would want them to dislike the position if they lack them.

One way to do that is by describing how an example workday at that position might look like with a heavy emphasis on the personal skills required.

For example, instead of saying <q>The perfect candidate must have excellent time management skills</q>, let's take a moment and think about why we would want this skill from a candidate. Then we might explain how it will be connected to their work: <q>You'll have to assess priorities in a tight deadline environment and act upon them</q>.

This will discourage people lacking this particular skill from applying without them even knowing they have just self-evaluated it.

## Stating the Budget

Should we state the budget for the position in the job description? There is no one right answer to this question so let's think a little bit about the pros and cons of stating the budget upfront.

### Pros

- It statistically increases the number of people that apply for the position (which might or might not be a good thing depending on how many candidates we are expecting).

- It will also automatically filter candidates that are out of our price range. The budget talks usually happen after the interview rounds which means that we might have wasted precious resources interviewing a candidate that we can't hire for budget reasons instead of interviewing another one.

- Discussing the expected salary with a candidate is more or less a kind of bargaining which might make them feel like we do not share their best interest which is not a great way to start a relationship.

### Cons

- If the job offer is in the lower half of the listed budget, the candidate might feel cheated. We are inevitably going to pay more than we would have otherwise but to be fair we can think of this money as being spent for the better well-being of our new employee.

- We are giving insights of our budget to our direct competitors which might not be a good idea if we think there is somebody who is actively looking to outbid us.

### Everything Else

At this point we should be done crafting our job description. Everything else can be safely removed in order to keep it short. 

If someone is really interested in our company they will probably go to our website or social media to check for more information. Making the advert unnecessarily large will only reduce the number of people who will actually read it.

## Next Steps

This way of crafting job descriptions maximizes the chance of the right candidate applying for the job. At the same time it minimizes the number of non-suitable applications thus allowing us to easily identify the right one.

At this point we should have received a bit more applications than people we can interview. So next we'll be discussing pre-screening techniques and how to identify how much resources to spend on each candidate.
