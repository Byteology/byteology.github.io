# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 5: Screening

Screening is arguably the hardest part of the whole recruitment process. This is the time when get the most valuable information about a candidate. It usually happens in the form of either a single or multiple interviews but as always we should keep that to a minimum. 

Because of the time limitations we inevitably have, we need to carefully prepare beforehand so everything we do will align with the skill canvas and the data we currently have.

## Preparation

Let's take a look at the skill canvas and the candidate's results from the pre-screening. We should carefully craft appropriate conversations for every skill that was not already covered by the pre-screening. We used the word *"conversation"* instead of *"questions"* on purpose.

An interview is not a trivia exam. Knowledge is only a part of what makes up a skill. A skill is the ability to apply knowledge and this is what we are looking for. The simplest way to understand if someone has a skill in a certain field is to find out if they can hold an opinion on it and how they react when presented with conflicting ideas. 

For example we could ask a candidate something along the lines of <q>Can you tell me about the SOLID principles</q> but that will only tell us if they have read the Wikipedia article or if they have been asked this question on another interview. 

Instead we might want to ask them for their opinion on the controversy around the dependency inversion principle. Maybe they will try to defend it, maybe they will try to prove that it is too extreme, maybe they will hold an opinion that it is more of a guideline than an actual rule. Then we can try to challenge them on what they just said and see if they have the ability to look at the topic through different lens. This way we can be fairly confident if the candidate has achieved a certain mastery over the field.

When we have prepared a couple of conversation for each skill in the canvas we'll be ready to navigate the interview in such a way that we'll get the most valuable information for the least amount of time.

## The Interview

One of the main goals of the interview is to keep the candidate is in their usual mindset instead of their *"trying to remember something"* one. We can treat their mindsets as different personas and we want to get information only from the one they'll be working with.

Keeping the interview in a conversation format helps a lot with that. With enough experience we'll be able to weave the topics we prepared beforehand into a single overarching conversation. 

Additionally, we don't have to go through all the topics in their depths. At some point we'll evaluate a certain skill with a certain confidence level and we can transition to the next one we would like to test. The goal is to do that as smoothly as possible. 

One of the reasons we prepared a couple of conversations per skill is so that we can have different entry points depending on where in the conversation we are at a certain moment. 

### About Stress

This way of conducting the interview also helps the candidate feel more comfortable because they don't follow the exam scenario. We should understand that the interviewee is in a bad spot. They might be nervous, worried or outright scared.

This might happen because getting this job is really important to them, because there are five people who are conducting this interview (we should really keep this number to a minimum) or they just might have trouble keeping calm when they are asked about a topic they are not confident in.

On that note, we should always be aware of how nervous the interviewee is at any moment and try to calm them down. There are many ways to do so and they vary depending on the situation but we'll list a couple of the most common and successful ones.

- The first one is to not acknowledge that they are nervous and just ask them a couple of related to the current topic questions you know they will answer correctly and then chat about that for a bit. This gives them a moment to catch their breath and get back into *"the zone"*.

- Another one is to actually take time and provide some additional information on the topic that the candidate omitted. This makes them feel better because the conversation is going on without having weird pauses or jumps due to their lack of certain knowledge. It also helps them learn new things and it reduces the time you'll spend on providing feedback later.

If we fail to calm down a nervous candidate, continuing the interview will not tell us anything about their skills. Instead it will tell us how well they can work under pressure which is usually not a requirement for their job.

 ### Let Candidates Choose Topics

We must remember that the interview is a two-way street. This is what *"inter"* means. There should be enough time to let the person ask us questions and to pick their own topics. This way we may also understand a little bit more about them, about what drives them and what they find interesting.

Additionally, candidates are inclined to choose topics they are most skilled in so this way we can find their greatest strengths even if we omitted them during the rest of the conversation. 

### Feedback

After every interview candidates may ask for feedback on how they have done. But regardless of whether they did it or not, we should provide it. This serves a few really important purposes.

- Verbalizing the feedback helps us better understand what we are looking for and helps us craft better skill canvases in the future.

- It builds trust and transparency between us and the candidate. That's a great thing to do even if we don't plan to hire them. We have had many successful candidates referred to us by people we haven't hired.

- It helps the candidates grow and become better experts in the future and as interviewers we have a responsibility to try and help people even if they are not the right fit for our company right now.

- 30 minutes after the interview, we forget about 70% of the feedback that we have to give. We don't need to wait for a hiring decision before giving our feedback.

- And on that note when a hiring decision is made, we should take a minute and inform the candidate regardless of the decision itself. They will appreciate it tremendously and will probably spread a good word.

## Next Steps

The recruitment process doesn't end with a hiring. It ends when we have a new employee that is fully integrated within the team. Next we'll discuss how to do that through onboarding and trainings.
