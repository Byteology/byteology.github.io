# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 5: Screening

The actual interview is arguably the hardest part of the whole process. During it we'll be gathering the majority of information about the candidates thus helping us make an informed decision. However, we have only so much time to gather that information so we need to carefully prepare beforehand.

## Preparation

Let's take a look at the skill canvas and focus our efforts on them. We should carefully craft appropriate conversations beforehand. We used the word *"conversation"* instead of *"questions"* on purpose.

The interview is not a trivia exam. We might ask a candidate something along the lines of <q>Can you tell me about the SOLID principles</q> but that usually doesn't help us understand if the candidate has the required skills to apply them in practice.

Instead we might want to ask them for their opinion on the controversy around the dependency inversion principle. Maybe they will try to defend it, maybe they will try to prove that it is too extreme, maybe they will hold an opinion that it is more of a guideline than an actual rule. Either way we'll understand a lot more about the interviewee than checking if they have read the Wikipedia article or have been asked the same question at another interview.

The goal is to keep a conversation going so the candidate is in their usual mindset instead of their *"trying to remember something"* one.

## About Stress

This way of conducting the interview also helps the candidate feel more comfortable because they don't follow the exam scenario. We should understand that the interviewee is in a bad spot. They might be nervous, worried or outright scared.

This might happen because getting this job is really important to them, because there are five people who are conducting this interview (please keep this number to a minimum) or they just might have trouble keeping calm when they are asked about a topic they are not confident in.

On that note, we should always be aware of how nervous the interviewee is at any moment and try to calm them down. There are many ways to do so and they vary depending on the situation but we'll list a couple of the most common and successful ones.

- The first one is to not acknowledge that they are nervous and just ask them a couple of related to the current topic questions you know they will answer correctly. This gives them a moment to catch their breath and get back into *"the zone"*.

- Another one is to actually take time and provide some additional information on the topic that the candidate omitted. This makes them feel better because the conversation is going on without having weird pauses or jumps due to their lack of certain knowledge. It also helps them learn new things and it reduces the time you'll spend on providing feedback later.

If we fail to calm down a nervous candidate, continuing the interview will not tell us anything about their skills. Instead it will tell us how well they can work under pressure which is usually not a requirement for their job.

 ## Let Candidates Choose Topics

- We must remember that the interview is a two-way street. This is what *"inter"* means. There should be enough time to let the person ask you questions and to pick their own topics. This way we may also understand a little bit more about them, about what drives them and what they find interesting.

## Feedback

After every interview candidates may ask for feedback on how they have done. But regardless of whether they did it or not, we should provide it. This serves a few really important purposes.

- Verbalizing the feedback helps us better understand what we are looking for and helps us craft better interviews in the future.

- It builds trust and transparency between us and the candidate. That's a great thing to do even if we don't plan to hire them. We have had many successful candidates referred to us by people we haven't hired.

- It helps the candidates grow and become better experts in the future and as interviewers we have a responsibility to try and help people even if they are not the right fit for our company right now.

- 30 minutes after the interview, we forget about 70% of the feedback that we have to give. We don't need to wait for a hiring decision before giving our feedback.

- And on that note when a hiring decision is made, we should take a minute and inform the candidate regardless of the decision itself. They will appreciate it tremendously and will probably spread a good word.
