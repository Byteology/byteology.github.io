# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 2: Defining a Strategy

Now that we have our skill canvas completed, we are ready to continue with the next step of the process and we'll begin by evaluating the constraints within which we'll be operating.

## Constraints Evaluation

When recruiting we are always constrained by some kind of resources. Some of the most common are deadlines, the availability of key people involved in the process and finances.

Being aware of these constraints allows us to create a skill-testing strategy that will increase our chances of successful recruitment tremendously. Let's examine some of them:

### Deadlines

A deadline refers to the time available before a new employee has to be integrated as a part of the team and work (semi-)independently. Having a short deadline reduces the time we have for both the recruitment process itself and any potential trainings. 

When faced with a strict deadline we must take into consideration the amount of time it would require for a candidate to learn each of the teachable core skills they might be missing and add it to their potential start date. If this extends past the deadline it means that we have to test teachable core skills with way higher confidence than usual as we can't afford to teach them later. 

Another problem with strict deadlines is that they introduce a time limit for the recruitment process as a whole. If this limit is too short we might not be able to interview enough people and might have to choose from a suboptimal pool of talents. This can be somehow mitigated in two ways:

 The first is by having multiple teams working on the recruitment process asynchronously but this comes with the price of reduced consistency between interviews. 
 
 The second way is to reduce the thoroughness of the process which can actually be a good thing but we'll talk about that a little bit later. 

### Team Availability

Another common constraint we face is team availability. This occurs most noticeably in the team members responsible for performing interviews. These people are usually heavily involved in the core operations of the business and might not have enough time for recruitment work.

Additionally they might not have the optimal interviewing skillset as it is usually different then the one required for their actual jobs.

There are a few ways to tackle this. The easiest one is to outsource some of the work as this will let our existing team members to focus on the core business of our organization.

Another way to deal with this is to teach and enable more people to perform interviews. Bear in mind that it certainly helps but it is not a necessity to have the most experienced and valuable team members (in term of the core business) to participate heavily in the recruitment process.

### Finances

Having a tight constraint on the finances for the recruitment process can limit our options but there is no real way around that. We might like to reduce the outsourced part of the recruitment process as much as possible at the cost of team availability and we'll have to achieve greater confidence when testing skills that are otherwise externally teachable.

## Thoroughness vs Brevity

The longer our interview process is - the higher chances we have to correctly determine if a potential applicant is a good fit. The problem is that we have limited time and resources.

In other words - the longer we spend on a single application - the less applicants we'll be able to interview, thus reducing our chances to find a good fit. On the other hand, if we don't spend enough time - we won't be able to identify potentially great candidates.

Additionally, candidates usually don't stop applying for other positions in different companies until they get a satisfactory job offer and if they receive one in the middle of our interview process, it is very unlikely they'll finish it.

Fortunately, the benefits of increasing the thoroughness of our process quickly hits diminishing returns and with careful planning and consideration you might be able to get to this point while simultaneously keeping the process quite brief.

## The Game Plan

Now that we are aware of our requirements and constrains it is time to write down our strategy. It usually consists of a few things:

- The number of people we would like to interview and the time we will spend on each one
- The confidence with which we would like to test each skill on the canvas
- The means of testing each skill in terms of which part(s) of the process is able to do it with the required confidence
- Which people or teams will be responsible for each subsequent part of the process
- A plan for training and onboarding the new hirees

## Next Steps

At this point we can treat the process as any other project and apply similar project management techniques.

Next we'll take a look at some of the important steps of the recruitment process and how we can use them to execute our strategy.
