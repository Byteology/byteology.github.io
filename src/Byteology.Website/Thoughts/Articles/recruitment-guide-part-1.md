# Concise Guide to Specialized Recruitment - Part 1: Creating a Skill Canvas

Employees are the lifeblood of every company. They are the ones creating our products, providing our services and driving our growth and innovation. Because of this, it is of utmost importance to choose them with meticulous care.

Unfortunately, this is a difficult process full of pitfalls.  How do you identify a great candidate? How do you even know what *"a great candidate"* is?

We have spent over a decade thinking about these problems and are ready to share some of our insights in this guide. It is written with technical positions in mind but most of it applies to any job opening.

## What is a Skill Canvas

The recruitment process consists of a lot of parts such as crafting job descriptions, pre-screening candidates, preparing interview scenarios, building proper training and onboarding procedures, etc. 

In a successful process all of these work together towards a singular well-defined goal. The skill canvas is a tool that help us define it thus allowing everyone involved in the recruitment process to share the same vision.

The canvas mainly consists of a list of unambiguously described and quantified skills of what we are looking for in a candidate as well as the reasoning behind it.

Creating it is arguably the most important step in the whole process yet it is oftentimes either completely ignored or it's being done idly by a single person for less than an hour.

## The Skill List

The first step of creating a skill canvas is to list all skills related to the particular position. 

Though remember, we are not looking for the perfect human being. We probably don't need a team full of team leaders or people thinking outside of the box.

It helps tremendously to write down a once-sentence reasoning of why we chose each of the skills listed. It keeps everyone on board and it makes future analysis easier.

Although, not necessary, we can group the skills in two categories:

### Technical Skills

Technical skills are the ones that are related to some kind of expertise regarding a certain piece of technology, software or specialized knowledge and are deeply rooted in a particular field of study. Usually they will be listed by the engineering team.

### Personal Skills

Personal skills or soft skills are the ones that do not relate to a particular field of study. They might be willingness to teach or mentor others, the ability to organize a group of people, a certain way of tackling problems, dealing with interpersonal issues, working under pressure, etc.

## Skill Definitions and Expertise Levels

At this point we might have written something along the lines of <q>The candidate must have at least 5 years of experience working in microservices architectures</q>. Bear in mind that experience is only a small part of what builds up mastery and is not really a skill.

Let's try to be a little bit more specific about what this kind experience means to us. For example, we might be looking for a particular level of autonomy when solving problems that our new employee will encounter: <q>The candidate should be able to investigate and identify race conditions within a complex microservice architecture on their own</q>.

Phrasing it like that will help us immensely in crafting both our job description and interview scenarios and allows everyone involved in the recruitment process to share the same vision.

## Quantifying the Skills

It is highly unlikely that during the recruitment process we'll be able to test all candidates on every single skill on the canvas with as much depth as we would like. Because of this we need some kind of system to help us define our strategy.

To do this, we should evaluate all skills on the canvas on two additional characteristics.

### Importance

This will help us at the later stages of the process by allowing us to focus our efforts on the things that matter most. Generally, there are 3 types of skills:

- **Core** - a skill that is essential for the job and is strictly necessary for even attempting it.
- **Auxiliary** - a skill that is not necessarily required for the job but has a substantial impact on it.
- **Tangent** - a skill that is somehow related to the job but it is possible for a skilled professional to lack it.

### Teachability

Next, it is time to determine what is the approximate cost for teaching each of the skills. Every skill generally falls in one of these 3 categories.

- **Internally teachable** - a skill that our organization has the ability and resources to teach. The resources usually are the time of the trainee and the availability of willing and able personnel that will conduct some kind of a training program.
- **Externally teachable** - a skill that our organization doesn't have the ability or resources to teach internally but can afford to outsource it. The resources that are usually associated with that are the time of the trainee, and the financial cost of the third-party that will conduct the training.
- **Unteachable** - a skill that is not teachable given a reasonable amount of time or other resources. 

## Next Steps

Having completed the skill canvas, we can now be sure that every single step of the recruitment process will work in unison towards the same goal. 

Next, we are ready to start defining our recruitment strategy.
