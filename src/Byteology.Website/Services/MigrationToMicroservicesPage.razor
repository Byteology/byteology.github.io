Because of that, modern enterprises are moving their legacy monolithic systems to microservices architecture."/>

<CardsSection Header="Benefits of the Microservice Architecture"
              Text="As the name suggests, microservices are small units that break up a monolithic application into a set of independent services. Unlike slow and heavy monolithic applications, microservices are faster to develop and deploy. Migrating from a monolithic architecture to a microservice one provides a lot of benefits, most important of which are as follows:"

Usually the right time to migrate a monolithic application is when your organization is growing and is facing productivity and scaling issues or when you start experiencing disruption in the communication between teams." />
