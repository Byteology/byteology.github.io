# Software Engineering
Software engineering is more than just programming. Instead it is a complex process that spans many fields of study. We have spent decades on improving each of them and are ready to help you in every aspect of your next software development endeavor.

## Project Management
Software development can be a complex project involving anything between a few people and a large number of teams, all working together towards a common goal. As a result some kind of project management system should be used.

There are a huge number of already existing systems and methodologies such as: Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), the Spiral Model, different variations of the Crystal method and many more.

Each of these approaches has its benefits but none are perfect; they are designed to solve a specific set of problems and it is highly unlikely that they will align completely with the unique challenges of every project or team.

Therefore, it is essential to be able to borrow useful elements from existing methodologies and create a specialized project management system that fits your specific needs.

## Design and Architecture
Software design and architecture are essential parts of software engineering because they lay the foundation for creating reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems. 

They ensure that the software meets the desired functionality and performance requirements while promoting code reusability and reducing the likelihood of errors or bugs, ultimately leading to higher quality and efficient software development.

As always, there are a lot of methodologies such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Rapid Application Development (RAD), Feature-Driven Development (FDD), Event Sourcing, Microservice Architecture, etc. 

All of them solve some kind of problem and there is no silver bullet. We need to carefully evaluate the needs of the project and pick or create solutions that specifically target them.

## Development
The development phase is the most straightforward and the least tangible part of the software engineering process. Extensive volumes of literature expound upon the essential qualities of proficient development and intriguingly, these expositions often present differing viewpoints.

While it seems impossible to establish a consistent definition, the next best thing we managed to generalize is avoiding "programming by coincidence" at all costs. 

In other words, every piece of code should be written with a clear understanding of the underlying principles and logic, consequently and undeniably increasing software quality. 

## Quality Assurance
Quality assurance involves systematic testing and validation processes aimed at identifying and resolving issues, thereby ensuring a high level of software quality and customer satisfaction.

These processes can range from manual testing to various forms of automated testing and approaches closely related with development, such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), Code Reviews, Pair Programming, and more.

Each of these approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages, and their effectiveness can vary based on implementation. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly study both the processes and the needs of the project and the team in order to select an appropriate quality assurance methodology.

## What We Do
We'll be happy to assist you throughout your software engineering journey. Employing a systematic approach and scientific generalization we can help you to: 

- Optimize and refine your project management process or build a custom one catering to the specific needs of the team and the project
- Create proof of concept and test the viability of your idea
- Design a reliable software architecture that will serve as a foundation for a great software
- Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) or a complete software application
- Establish a rigorous quality assurance process
