<Title class="[&_strong]:text-accent" Header="Our Mission" Icon="@typeof(Icons.ScientificGeneralization)" Text="Every problem begins as a simple one and then grows in complexity over time. Complexity differs from difficulty though. There are profound difficulties in simple things and only by understanding and tackling those, you can truly master the ever-growing complexity of modern solutions.

This concept is called **scientific generalization** and it is the reason we created Byteology. Our mission and passion is bringing it to the Software Engineering world thus allowing software to scale in complexity but not in difficulty.​

Byteology's main operation is based in Sofia, Bulgaria and is governed by EU jurisdiction and follows EU regulations, privacy and compliance laws." />
