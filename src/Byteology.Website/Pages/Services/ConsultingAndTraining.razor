       Text="The terms *“training”* and *“consulting”* are often used interchangeably but in reality they solve different problems. In this article we’ll give a quick overview of what the difference is and when to use each one.

In short, the difference between consulting and training can be explained this way:
- **Consulting advises your team on what to do**
- **Training teaches a skill so the team knows how to do it**"/>


<Section Header="Consulting"
         Text="Consultants are industry experts and are able assess and prescribe solutions and advise employees or companies what to do when they are in need. Their success is usually measured by the deployment of a solution or by an answer to a set of questions.

As such consulting is best used when a team is confronted with a specific problem that is not a part of their area of expertise and expanding that area is either infeasible or unnecessary." />

<Section Header="Training"
         Text="On the other hand, the goal of a training is to expand the area of expertise of a particular person or team in such a way that they will be able to independently solve problems that may arise in said area.

Because of this, trainers need to be industry experts and simultaneously possess a set of skills required for teaching which are oftentimes two different fields of study.

Trainings are the suggested tool to be used when a team lacks expertise in an area in which they are about to work on a regular basis." />
