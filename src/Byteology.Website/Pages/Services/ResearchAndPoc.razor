       Text="A proof of concept (or PoC for short) is the first and arguably one of the most essential steps in the software development process.

A proof of concept doesn’t produce deliverables, as the core issue being considered is the feasibility of the project. Because of this it can be developed quickly and undergo many iterations, thus allowing it to provide valuable insights about the project before the actual development has begun."/>

Because of this it is a great tool to identify which technology stack is the most suitable for your project. This way, you’ll be using the right tools for the job which solves a lot of problems before they even occur."),

There is no available statistics on how much exactly but we have seen cases of 34% reduction of costs by risk mitigation alone."),

<Section Text="Creating a successful proof of concept requires a whole set of skills that differ from those needed for the actual development of the software. Because of this it might be a good idea to outsource your PoCs in certain situations. If this is the case, don’t hesitate to contact us. We have spent years honing our PoC crafting skills and we’ll be happy to assist you in your next endeavor." />
