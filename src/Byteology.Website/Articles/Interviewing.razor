        <h1>A Concise Guide to Conducting Technical Interviews</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Employees are the lifeblood of every company. They are the ones creating our products, providing our services
        and driving our growth and innovation. Because of this, it is of utmost importance to choose them with
        meticulous care.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, this is a difficult process full of pitfalls. How do you craft a successful job advert?
        How do you identify a great candidate? How do you even know what <em>"a great candidate"</em> is?
    </p>
    <p>
        We have spent over a decade thinking about these problems and are ready to share some of our insights in this
        guide. It is written with technical positions in mind but most of it applies to any job opening.
    </p>

<section class="panel styled-content">
    <h2>Thoroughness vs Brevity</h2>
    <p>
        The longer your interview process is - the higher chances you have to correctly determine if a potential
        applicant is a good fit. The problem is that you have limited time and resources for conducting interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words - the longer you spend on a single application - the less applicants you’ll be able to interview,
        thus reducing your chances to find a good fit. On the other hand, if you don’t spend enough time - you won’t be
        able to identify potentially great candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, candidates usually don’t stop applying for other positions in different companies until they get
        a satisfactory job offer and if they receive one in the middle of your interview process, it is very unlikely
        they'll finish it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, the benefits of increasing the thoroughness of your process quickly hit diminishing returns and
        with careful planning and consideration you might be able to get to this point while simultaneously keeping
        the process quite brief.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following sections we will go through all the steps of a typical interview process and talk about how to
        get the most out of them.
    </p>

<section class="panel styled-content">
    <h2>Figuring Out What Skills You Are Looking For</h2>
    <p>
        This step is arguably the most important one in the whole process yet it is oftentimes either completely
        ignored or it is being done idly by a single person for less than an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having the skills you are looking for in a candidate listed and written down helps tremendously in the rest
        of the process. It helps you craft better adverts and interviews and it allows all of the people involved in
        the process to share the same vision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To identify the skills you are looking for, it helps to group them into two different categories.
    </p>

            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Technical skills are the ones that are related to some kind of expertise regarding a certain piece of
            technology, software or specialized knowledge and are deeply rooted in a particular field of study.
            Usually they will be listed by your engineering team.
        </p>
        <p>Beware that it is really tempting to list every piece of technology that your company uses. You should try
            to trim it down to the core skills that the potential new employee will practice on an everyday basis and
            those that are not acceptable to be learned during the job. People are willing to grow and are going to
            learn everything else on the go.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card-sm styled-content">
        <div class="icon-title-sm">
            <PersonIcon/>
            <h3>Personal Skills</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Personal skills are the ones that do not relate to a particular field of study. They might be willingness
            to teach or mentor others, the ability to organize a group of people, a certain way of tackling problems,
            dealing with interpersonal issues, working under pressure, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though remember, you are not looking for the perfect human being and include only those that are relevant
            to the particular position. You probably don’t need a team full of team leaders or people thinking outside
            of the box. In some cases you might not even want everybody to have a strong analytical mindset.
        </p>

<section class="panel styled-content">
    <h2>About Expertise Levels</h2>
    <p>
        At this point you might have written something along the lines of <q>The candidate must have at least 5
            years of experience working in microservices architectures</q>. Bear in mind that experience is only a
        small partof what builds up mastery and is not really a skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try to be a little bit more specific about what this kind experience means to you. For example, you might be
        looking for a particular level of autonomy when solving problems that your new employee will encounter:
        <q>The candidate should be able to investigate and identify race conditions within a complex microservice
            architecture on their own</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Phrasing it like that will help you immensely in crafting both your job advert and interview questions.

    <h2>The Job Advert</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you know what you are looking for in potential candidates, it is time to start crafting your job
        advert. Thankfully, you are already half done at this point, but before we continue we need to understand a
        few things.
    </p>

            <h3 class="card-title">
                <span class="counter">01</span>
                <span>How Potential Candidates Interact With Job Adverts</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Everything in this section has a big <em>"in general"</em> asterisk attached to it. Additionally, this is
                the most opinionated part of this guide so take it with a grain of salt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Potential candidates will rarely stumble upon your job advert by accident. Most of the time they are
                actively looking for their next job and are browsing through some kind of job adverts website.
            </p>
            <p>
                These websites often have very limited searching functionalities. In most cases these are a place of work,
                some vague industry category like <em>"IT services"</em> and maybe some predefined list of technologies or
                programming languages like <em>".NET Core"</em>, <em>"C++"</em>, etc. As you can imagine, any combination
                of these filters yields hundreds, if not thousands of results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Potential candidates have limited time as well, so they are not going to click through every single one in
                order to figure out if they are a good match before applying. Because of that they are playing a numbers
                game. Two of them actually:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The first one is
                        <q>Just by glancing at the title of an advert can I determine if the chances that
                            I’m a good fit are above random</q>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The titles of job adverts are usually some kind of skill requirement and the potential candidates
                        will answer their question by figuring out if they have this particular skill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem is that the more vague the skill is - the less an affirmative answer raises the odds of
                        being a good fit. For example, falling into the category of
                        <em>"C#.NET Developer with SAP B1
                            experience for a marketplace"</em> means a lot more than falling into the category of
                        <em>"Senior
                            Software Engineer"</em>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Once a potential candidate has clicked on a job advert, comes their second question:
                        <q>How to
                            determine if the time I’ll spend applying for this position will be worth the chance I have to be a
                            good fit</q>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This usually happens by checking the listed requirements. If they positively consider themselves to
                        possess at least 80% (sometimes even lower) of the listed skills - they will consider applying for
                        the position. Take a note of that. It will help us a little bit later in a non-intuitive way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the candidate is not able to answer that question fast, they will most likely resort to going
                        back to browsing adverts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only after the potential candidate has decided that it might be worth their while to apply for this
                        position, they may try to figure out if they’ll actually like working at it. They'll scan the
                        advert for any clues about that and this will be their last deciding factor before they take action.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

                <span class="counter">02</span>
                <span>The Goals of an Advert</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Before starting to craft our job advert, we need to know one more thing: what makes an advert successful.
            </p>
            <p>
                After publishing your job advert only a certain number of people will actually see or be interested in it
                and the higher this number is - the higher the chances that a great candidate will be among them. So the
                first goal of a successful job advert is to increase the number of people that will interact with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point candidates will start sending you applications. In most cases they will be way more than you
                have resources to interview people and you will have to resort to screening them by their application alone,
                which is not really effective for reasons we will describe a bit later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, a great tool for screening candidates is the job advert itself. If we craft it correctly it
                will automatically filter a lot of the people that are not a good fit but we have to be careful not to
                filter great candidates as well. So how do we do that?
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card styled-content">
            <h3 class="card-title">
                <span class="counter">03</span>
                <span>Crafting The Job Advert</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Armed with this knowledge and the list of skills that you are looking for in a candidate, we are now
                ready to craft the perfect job advert.
            </p>
            <h4>The Title</h4>
            <p>
                Let’s begin with the title. As we said earlier in order to attract the highest number of relevant
                candidates we must set the title to be the core requirement of the position written in the most
                specific way possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also safely remove expertise levels like <em>"Junior/Regular/Senior"</em> because they are way
                too subjective and this makes them vague. A potential candidate’s idea of these levels may and
                will wildly differ from yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only exception being intern positions as pretty much everyone has the same understanding of the
                word <em>"intern"</em>.
            </p>
            <h4>Technical Skill Requirements</h4>
            <p>
                Now let’s continue with the list of skill requirements. Remember when we said that people will apply if
                they think they possess 80% of the required skills? This means that the bigger the list - the higher
                the chance candidates will apply while missing some of the core skills for the position and this might
                be a hard thing to catch on the application level.
            </p>
            <p>
                So your best option is to include only the skills you are not willing to compromise for and those that
                are not acceptable to be learned during the job but don’t worry, you’ll test for the non-essentials
                during the interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will want to write these skill requirements as specific as possible for the same reason we wrote
                the title that way. People are objectively bad at evaluating themselves and the more vague a skill is
                described - the more likely it is for them to think they possess it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also want to ditch the <em>"required years of experience"</em> for a certain technology.
                Years of experience are only a small part of what builds up expertise and people know or at least feel
                it so they are inclined to ignore it. Also there are so many job adverts out there that require an
                unreasonable amount of years of experience that there are running jokes about it and people stopped
                paying attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead you might just explain what those years of experience mean to you. E.g. <q>You should be able
                    to understand and optimize SQL Server execution plans</q>. Fortunately, we already did that when we
                were deciding on what skills we are looking for.
            </p>

            <h4>Personal Skill Requirements</h4>
            <p>
                Don’t list any of the personal skills you are looking for. People are even more terrible at
                self-evaluating their personal skills than their technical ones. We have never met a single person that
                said they are not a great problem solver or fast learner.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you include the personal skills, potential candidates will mentally check them off when skimming
                through the list of requirements and this will make them more likely to apply even if they miss some
                of the important technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might want to include the required personal skills in the job advert though. We will do that but
                we’ll cast it in another light. Instead of making potential candidates decide if they have a list of
                personal skills we would want them to dislike the position if they lack them.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to do that is by describing how an example workday at that position might look like with a
                heavy emphasis on the personal skills required.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, instead of saying <q>The perfect candidate must have excellent time management
                    skills</q>, take a moment and think about why you would want this skill from a candidate. Then you
                might explain how it will be connected to their work: <q>You'll have to assess priorities in a tight
                deadline environment and act upon them</q>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will discourage people lacking this particular skill from applying without them even knowing they
                have just self-evaluated it.
            </p>

            <h4>Everything Else</h4>
            <p>
                At this point you should be done crafting your advert. Everything else can be safely removed in order
                to keep it short. If someone is really interested in your company they will probably go to your website
                to check for more information. Making the advert unnecessarily large will only reduce the number of
                people who will actually read it.

    <h2>Should you state your budget for the position?</h2>
    <p>
        There is no one right answer to this question so let’s think a little bit about the pros and cons of stating
        your budget upfront.
    </p>

    <section class="card-sm styled-content">
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It statistically increases the number of people that apply for the position (which might or might not
                be a good thing depending on how many candidates you are expecting).
            </li>
            <li>
                It will also automatically filter candidates that are out of your price range. The budget talks usually
                happen after the interview rounds which means that you might have wasted precious resources
                interviewing a candidate that you can’t hire for budget reasons instead of interviewing another
                candidate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Discussing the expected salary with a candidate is more or less a kind of bargaining which might make
                them feel like you as an employer do not share their best interest which is not a great way to start
                a relationship.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card-sm styled-content">
        <h3 class="!text-error">Cons</h3>
        <ul class="marker:!text-error">
            <li>
                If your job offer is in the lower half of the listed budget, the candidate might feel cheated.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are inevitably going to pay more than you would have otherwise but to be fair you can think of this
                money as being spent for the better wellbeing of your new employee.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are giving insights of your budget to your direct competitors which might not be a good idea if
                you think there is somebody who is actively looking to outbid you.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Motivation Letters</h2>
    <p>
        Motivation letters are a very specific tool at our disposal. They increase the thoroughness of your interview
        process but in return they pre-screen a lot of candidates. This can be of great help if you are receiving way
        too many applications than you can handle but unfortunately, it might not be an accurate screening.
    </p>
    <p>
        They make the process of applying harder which filters candidates based on motivation to apply for this exact
        job or sometimes by desperation to get any job at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, you will want to actually read and evaluate these and this costs additional resources while
        filtering candidates on what is basically an essay for a job that probably has nothing to do with writing.

        One great use for motivation letters though, is for intern positions or positions for which candidates are not
        required to have any previous experience. In these situations it might be really difficult to distinguish
        between candidates and their motivation letters might be the only tool you have available.

    <h2>The Application Round</h2>
    <p>
        At this point hopefully you have received more applications than people you can interview. Now you may wonder
        how to filter them.
    </p>
    <p>
        It might be tempting to pick the best-looking and the most refined CVs and it is definitely a tell about
        certain personal skills but bear in mind that you are not looking for the person who is able to craft the
        best CV.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only other thing you can do is keep statistics. You should keep track which universities and previous
        employers yielded successful interviews in the past. Maybe a certain style of writing, certain kind of
        certifications, years of experience or something entirely different.
    </p>
    <p>
        That doesn’t mean you should give a chance to anyone that doesn’t fit your statistics but it might help you
        when you are hard-pressed to choose which applicants to interview.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically you’ll create some kind of system to help you order applications but this is the part of the process
        in which you are trying to make a decision having only minimal information. This is why keeping statistics
        might be your best bet in the long term.
    </p>

    <h2>The Interview</h2>
    <p>
        The actual interview is arguably the hardest part of the whole process. During it you’ll be gathering the
        majority of information about the candidates thus helping you make an informed decision. However,
        you have only so much time to gather that information so you need to carefully prepare beforehand.
    </p>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
        Take a look at what are the skills that you are looking for in a candidate and focus your efforts on them.
        Carefully craft appropriate conversations beforehand. We used the word <em>"conversation"</em> instead of
        <em>"questions"</em> on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interview is not a trivia exam. You might ask a candidate <q>Can you tell me about the SOLID principles</q>
        but that usually doesn’t help you understand if the candidate has the required skills to apply them in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead you might ask them for their opinion on the controversy around the dependency inversion principle.
        Maybe they will try to defend it, maybe they will try to prove that it is too extreme, maybe they will hold an
        opinion that it is more of a guideline than an actual rule. Either way you’ll understand a lot more about the
        interviewee than checking if they have read the Wikipedia article or have been asked the same question at
        another interview.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is to keep a conversation going so the candidate is in their usual mindset instead of their
        <em>"trying to remember something"</em> one.
    </p>

    <h3>About Stress</h3>
    <p>
        This way of conducting the interview also helps the candidate feel more comfortable because they don’t follow
        the exam scenario. You should understand that the interviewee is in a bad spot. They might be nervous,
        worried or outright scared.
    </p>
    <p>
        This might happen because getting this job is really important to them, because there are five people who are
        conducting this interview (please keep this number to a minimum) or they just might have trouble keeping calm
        when they are asked about a topic they are not confident in.
    </p>
    <p>
        On that note, you should always be aware of how nervous the interviewee is at any moment and try to calm them
        down. There are many ways to do so and they vary depending on the situation but we'll list a couple of the most
        common and successful ones.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first one is to not acknowledge that they are nervous and just ask them a couple of related to the
            current topic questions you know they will answer correctly. This gives them a moment to catch their
            breath and get back into <em>"the zone"</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another one is to actually take time and provide some additional information on the topic that the
            candidate omitted. This makes them feel better because the conversation is going on without having weird
            pauses or jumps due to their lack of certain knowledge. It also helps them learn new things and it reduces
            the time you'll spend on providing feedback later.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you fail to calm down a nervous candidate, continuing the interview will not tell you anything about their
        skills. Instead it will tell you how well they can work under pressure which is usually not a requirement for
        their job.
    </p>

    <h3>Let Candidates Choose Topics</h3>
    <p>
        Remember that the interview is a two-way street. This is what <em>"inter"</em> means. Prepare enough time
        to let the person ask you questions and to pick their own topics. This way you’ll also understand a little bit
        more about them, about what drives them and what they find interesting.
    </p>

    <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
    <p>
        Homework assignments are a great way to increase the thoroughness of the interview process while keeping it
        brief (for you at least) although they come with a different load of problems.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It is hard to craft a homework assignment that will properly reflect the skills you are looking for.
        </li>
        <li>
            You'll have to do it over and over again. You’ll be surprised how fast the assignments and their proper
            solutions leak to the public. Additionally, different positions require different assignments.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can’t be sure that the solution comes from the assignee. Because of that you should at least
            schedule a call to talk with them about the solution. This combined with the actual grading of the
            solution will take time that you might want to spend somewhere else in the process.
        </li>
        <li>
            The whole homework assignment, grading and the follow-up interview may take weeks and during this time
            the candidate might receive a job offer from another company which may cause them to drop out of your
            interview process.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>
        After every interview candidates may ask for feedback on how they have done. But regardless of whether
        they did it or not, you should provide it. This serves a few really important purposes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Verbalizing the feedback helps you better understand what you are looking for and helps you craft better
            interviews in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
            It builds trust and transparency between you and the candidate. That’s a great thing to do even if you
            don’t plan to hire them. We have had many successful candidates referred to us by people we haven’t hired.
        </li>
        <li>
            It helps the candidates grow and become better experts in the future and as interviewers we have a
            responsibility to try and help people even if they are not the right fit for our company right now.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Remember that 30 minutes after the interview, you’ll forget about 70% of the feedback that you have to give.
        You don’t need to wait for a hiring decision before giving your feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        And on that note when a hiring decision is made, take a minute and inform the candidate regardless of the
        decision itself. They will appreciate it tremendously and will probably spread a good word.

    <h2>Interviewing as a Service</h2>
    <p>
        If you've come this far you probably understand that recruitment is a really important but complex process.
        Doing it properly requires skills that oftentime do not align with the core expertise of companies. Furthermore,
        the interviewing process may divert valuable resources in terms of engineers or other specialized personnel and
        thus disrupt operations.
    </p>

        business and rest assured you’ll hire great people that will help you grow.
